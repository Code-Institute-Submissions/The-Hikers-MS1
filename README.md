## UX

This website design will target at people of all ages for families and friends living in Ireland as well as those who intend to visit Ireland, potentially who like hiking and who are looking for information on the internet about hiking in Ireland.
The purpose of this project is generally simple but effective eye catching website presenting beautiful, amazing and unforgettable views. The priority is direct contact and links to social media.

---

**1. Strategy**

My goal in this project is to promote the group THE HIKERS on the market and increase interest in the tours they offer and grow their business by providing the UX simple, clean and user-friendly. 

### Business goals:
- Promote the new group on the market
- Demonstrate examples of tours to show customers what they can expect
- Increase the number of followers on social media
- Encouraging to spend time actively and discover beautiful Ireland

### Customer Goals:
- Easy to read information About Us, eye-catching pictures encouraging customers to  take advantage of the offer long enough to understand the content but not to overwhelm.
- Easy to find contact details to ask questions about a trip
- Easy to find links to social media accounts to follow the group
- Design with mobile devices in mind as this is probably the most common way to find information looking for holidays, trips 
- Fixed navigation bar providing user easy navigation reference.
- Fixed footer providing quick reference to Social Media links.

**2. Scope**

I chose the MVP (Minimal Viable Product) approach which:
- It provides users with pure UX
- It includes mobile-first website that is responsive on all devices.
- It fits with my current skills.
- It defines content quickly and focuses on contacting via email or social media. 

**3. Structure**
- The purpose of the Structure has been created as a single page containing sections/pages separated by eye-catching pictures using a parallax effect to encourage and attract the visitor's interest and  to enable users to quickly navigate through the website, easily assimilate information and have overview from of the trips to show what can be expected by buyers on the offered trips.
- Contact details have been placed in different parts of the website (footer, contact form, main page button, tours section) for easy access by the user and are provided via the e-mail, phone number and links to social media. 
- I decided to put the Gallery section separately to facilitate faster page loading due to the large number of photos

**4. Skeleton**

## Wireframe mockups:

- [Contact](assets/wireframes/contact-page.png)

- Pages/Section: Home, About/Tours, Contact
- Gallery in a separated page (changed through project development)
- Fixed navigation bar - Menu headings and pointing to each of the 4 Pages
- Fixed footer with Contact email-link and phone number and Social Media icons

**5. Surface**

 **Colors**
- As a primary color, I have chosen color green (#57ab24) that is not only associated with Ireland, but also suggest freshness, nature and green landscapes. They will also match the photos I have selected for the site. 
- As a additional color I choose a red (#dd3044) which i picked by the color picker from the image with skirts. That color will compliment green and make the important things like contact/sent buttons pop, so it will
 be noticed by the user immediately.
 -For the other colors I have chosen a combination of dark grey nad off-white, which are the darker and lighter shades of primary green colors to give a website a balanced contrast: 
 background color (#2b2d2a), body-text color (#fbfbfb), headings (#fbfbfb) and (#2b2d2a) .

 **Typography**
 
- For the main headings I have chosen the same font that was used in The Hikers logo which is the "Special Elite" with the group of fall-back font of cursive
- For the content I have chosen Oswald font with fall-back font of Sans-Serif, which is popular pairing font with "Special Elite" according to www.fontsgoogle.com 

 **Images**

- The image selection has been chosen very carefully to visually presents to charm users of the website with the beauty of Ireland and encourage to participate in offered trips
The hero image (View of Wicklow landscape) and background images (forest and happy-girl) and for tours section were downloaded from the Pexels and Pixaby. I have chosen a group of selected images for the about section and the gallery.

## Features

**Existing Features**
- Designed with HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap.
- One page with 4 sections acting as individual pages and one separate page for the gallery images 
- Fixed navigation allows user to easily navigate, regardless of which page visited.

**Features Left to Implement when skills develop**

Another feature idea
- As the owner is originally from Poland to encourage Polish visitors to explore Ireland, it is hoped to add a bilingual option (English & Polish) which will translate the page into the appropriate language.
- The "Sent" button contact form need to be functional so the details can be sent to the server via php
- Change short videos of excursions on the organized group trips, which today were implemented from youtube
- More comprehensive Tours section write more about tours option, and more detailed 
- Integration of Social media Page to have a live update feeds of planned trips and events.

**Project Bugs And solutions**

During the development of this project, trying to use the combination of Bootstrap, CSS3 and Html5 together was a big challenge for me and I had the impression that my project is one big virus which, after fixing one problem, crashes into another. In general, it seems to me that most of the problems I had were caused by insufficient knowledge of the newly learned programs and tools as well as experimenting with them, and here are some of them:
1. The contact links in the footer did not appeared correctly, after hover over with the mouse they fell apart, after consulting it with tutor assistance, the problem was wrong code in hover in contact-links which I set earlier by mistake. The solution was remove that line of code

![alttheissue](assets/images/contact-links-footer-problem.png)  ![altfoundissue](assets/images/contact-links-footer-problem-found.png)  ![altfixedissue](assets/images/contact-links-footer-fixed.png)

2. Problem with scrolling horizontal bar that appeared. To get around this after consulting it with the tutor assistance first I gave the html a value overflow:hidden which worked good, but later I found the real reason why the horizontal scrolling appeared. I noticed on the unicorn revealer that my background images were overflowing. 
I set for the both background images and for the whole body width: 100vw; which caused the problem. To solve this I removed the with of the pictures and the body

3. In the Gallery page, the entire content of the page, when resizing the screen, moved to the right edge of the screen and hid behind causing the gap on the left side, the problem was a very large margin which I set for the images for the whole margin.The solution was to remove margin and set margin:top and margin:bottom only.

![altleftsidegap](assets/images/left-side-gap.png)

4. Issue with the fixed top navbar was overlying on the other content and the headings on each section were hidden behind the navbar. After consulting with the tutor assistance the solution for this was set for each section an id="about/tours/contact/gallery" and in stylesheet.css set: border-top:3px solid transparent;
    margin-top: -3px;
