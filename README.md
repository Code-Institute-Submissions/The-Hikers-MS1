## Overview
---

 - This is my first Milestone 1 project which is part of the Code Instituteâ€™s FullStack Software Development Diploma Course. This project demonstrates the skills and knowledge of the HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4 and User Centric Frontend Development modules which I have learned recently on the course. 
 - The aim of this fictional website is to promote The Hikers group on the market, make the group recognizable and to present their offer of organized trips in the Irish mountains for people looking for adventure, unforgettable experiences, interested in discovering Irish mountain trails, spending time actively.

## User stories
1. As a new visitor, I want to navigate the site easily so that I can find what I need  effectively
2. As a new visitor I want to know how I can get more information about their offer so I can decide if I am interested in buying a tour
3. As an interested customer, I want to know how to contact the group to find out about new tours
4. As an interested observer and potential client, I want to follow the group on social media and keep up to date with its upcoming tours as well as see the opinions of people who have already participated in the tour.
5. As an interested customer I would like to see some visual examples from previous tours

## UX

This website design will target at people of all ages for families and friends living in Ireland as well as those who intend to visit Ireland, potentially who like hiking and who are looking for information on the internet about hiking in Ireland.
The purpose of this project is generally simple but effective eye catching website presenting beautiful, amazing and unforgettable views. The priority is direct contact and links to social media.

**1. Strategy**

My goal in this project is to promote the group on the market and increase interest in the tours they offer and grow their business by providing the UX simple, clean and user-friendly. 

### Business goals:
- Promote the new group on the market
- Demonstrate examples of tours to show customers what they can expect
- Increase the number of followers on social media
- Encouraging to spend time actively and discover beautiful Ireland

### Customer Goals:
- Easy to read information About Us, eye-catching pictures encouraging customers to  take advantage of the offer long enough to understand the content but not to overwhelm.
- Easy to find contact details to ask questions about a trip
- Easy to find links to social media accounts to follow the group
- Design with mobile devices in mind as this is probably the most common way to find information looking for holidays, trips 
- Fixed navigation bar providing user easy navigation reference.
- Fixed footer providing quick reference to Social Media links.

**2. Scope**

I chose the MVP (Minimal Viable Product) approach which:
- It provides users with pure UX
- It includes mobile-first website that is responsive on all devices.
- It fits with my current skills.
- It defines content quickly and focuses on contacting via email or social media. 

**3. Structure**

The main purpose of the structure is to enable users to quickly navigate through the website, easily assimilate information and have overview from of the trips to show what can be expected by buyers on the offered trips. A selection of high-quality images that gives special accent for the website. Contact details are provided via the e-mail contact form  and links to social media in the footer.

**5. Surface**

 **Colors**
- As a primary color, I have chosen color green (#57ab24) that is not only associated with Ireland, but also suggest freshness, nature and green landscapes. They will also match the photos I have selected for the site. 
- As a additional color I choose a red (#dd3044) which i picked by the color picker from the image with skirts. That color will compliment green and make the important things like contact/sent buttons pop, so it will be noticed by the user immediately. - -For the other colors I have chosen a combination of dark grey nad off-white to give your website a softer, more inviting look and readability and also maintain strong, balanced contrast: background color (#303030), body-text color (#f8f9fa), headings #f8f9fa and #303030.


 **Typography**
 
- For the main headings I have chosen the same font that was used in The Hikers logo which is the "Special Elite" with the group of fall-back font of cursive
- For the content I have chosen Oswald font with fall-back font of Sans-Serif, which is popular pairing font with "Special Elite" according to www.fontsgoogle.com 

 **Images**
The image selection has been chosen very carefully to visually presents to charm users of the website with the beauty ofIreland and encourage to participate in offered trips
The hero image (View of Wicklow landscape) and background images (forest and happy-girl) and for tours section were downloaded from the Pexels and Pixaby.I have chosen a group of selected images for the about section and the gallery.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

**Existing Features**
- Designed with HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap.
- One page with 4 sections acting as individual pages and one separate page for the gallery images 
- Fixed navigation allows user to easily navigate, regardless of which page visited.
- Fixed footer allows the user to easily access to social media links and contact details like email and phone number
- Fixed, stacked images for mobile views
- Home page and Contact And Enquiry Form with radio buttons
- Tours page and contact have additional Contact Us  and phone option
- In gallery page each picture has been linked, so that the user can see the image in a larger size

**Features Left to Implement when skills develop**

Another feature idea
- 	As the owner is originally from Poland to encourage Polish tourists to more explore Ireland, it is      hoped to add a bilingual option (English & Polish) which will translate the page into the appropriate language.
- The Sent button need to be functional so the details can be sent tot the server (PHP and Java script once learned)
- Add short videos of excursions on the trip, which today were not of good quality and must be recorded and edited again 
- More comprehensive Tours section write more about tours option, and more detailed 
- Integration of Social media Page to have a live update feeds of planned trips and events.
