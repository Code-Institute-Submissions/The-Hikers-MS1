## Overview
---

 - This is my first Milestone 1 project which is part of the Code Instituteâ€™s FullStack Software Development Diploma Course. This project demonstrates the skills and knowledge of the HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4 and User Centric Frontend Development modules which I have learned recently on the course. 
 - The aim of this fictional website is to promote The Hikers group on the market, make the group recognizable and to present their offer of organized trips in the Irish mountains for people looking for adventure, unforgettable experiences, interested in discovering Irish mountain trails, spending time actively.

## User stories
1. As a new visitor, I want to navigate the site easily so that I can find what I need  effectively
2. As a new visitor I want read about their offer so I can decide if I am interested in buying a tour with them
3. As an interested customer, I want to understand the tour booking process or how I can contact the group
4. As an interested observer and potential client, I want to follow the group on social media and keep up to date with its upcoming tours as well as see the opinions of people who have already participated in the tour.

## UX

This website design will target at people of all ages for families and friends living in Ireland as well as those who intend to visit Ireland, potentially who like hiking and who are looking for information on the internet about hiking in Ireland.
The purpose of this project is generally simple but effective eye  catching website presenting beautiful views, amazing unforgettable green landscapes and a tempting offer. The priority is direct contact and links to social media.

1. Strategy

My goal in this project is to promote the group on the market and increase interest in the tours they offer and grow their bussiness by providing the UX simple, clean and user-friendly. 

### Bussiness goals:
- Promote the new group on the market
- Demonstrate examples of tours to show customers what they can expect
- Increase the number of followers on social media
- Encouraging to spend time actively and discover beautiful Ireland

### Customer Goals:
- Easy to read information About Us, eye-catching pictures encouraging customers to  take advantage of the offer long enough to understand the content but not to overwhelm.
- Easy to find contact details to ask questions about a trip
- Easy to find links to social media accounts to follow the group
- Design with mobile devices in mind as this is probably the most common way to find information looking for hollidays, trips 
- Fixed navigation bar providing user easy navigation reference.
- Fixed footer providing quick reference to Social Media links.

2. Scope

I chose the MVP (Minimal Viable Product) approach which:
- It provides users with pure UX
- It includes mobile-first website that is responsive on all devices.
- It fits with my current skills.
- It defines content quickly and focuses on contacting via email or social media. 

3. Structure

The main purpose of the structure is to enable users to quickly navigate through the website, easily assimilate information and have overview from of the trips to show what can be expected by buyers on the offered trips. A selection of high-quality images that gives special accent for the website. Contact details are provided via the e-mail contact form  and links to social media in the footer.

5. Surface

 **Colors**
As the basic color, I chose shades of green that are associated mainly with Ireland, but also suggest freshness and nature, as a characteristic color I chose a shade of red, which according to uilderexpert.com perfectly matches green. I chose off-white as the background for the entire page. Colored fonts in shades of gray to give your website a softer, more inviting look and readability.


 **Typography**
 
- For the main headings I chose the same font that was used in the logo of the "Special Elite" group (with fall-back font of cursive)
- For the content I chose Oswald font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif), which is popular pairing font with "Special Elite" according to www.fontsgoogle.com 

 **Images**
the hero picture will be from the pexels a view of wiclow mountain and group pictures will be added for the gallery, about and tours
