## Overview
---
 - This is my first Milestone 1 project which is part of the Code Instituteâ€™s FullStack Software Development Diploma Course. This project demonstrates the skills and knowledge of the HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4 and User Centric Frontend Development modules which I have learned recently on the course. 
 - The aim of this website is to promote The Hikers group on the market, make the group recognizable and to present their offer of organized trips in the Irish mountains for people looking for adventure, unforgettable experiences, interested in discovering Irish mountain trails, spending time actively.

## UX

This website design will target people of all ages, families and friends living in Ireland as well as those who intend to visit Ireland, potentially who like hiking and who are looking for information on the internet about hiking in Ireland.
The purpose of this project is generally simple but effective. It encompasses an eye catching website presenting beautiful, amazing and unforgettable views, which prioritizes direct contact and links to social media.

---

**1. Strategy**

My goal in this project is to promote the group THE HIKERS on the market and increase interest in the tours they offer and grow their business by providing the UX simple, clean and user-friendly. 

### Business goals:
- Promote the new group on the market
- Demonstrate examples of tours to show customers what they can expect
- Increase the number of followers on social media
- Encourage to spend time actively and discover beautiful Ireland

### Customer Goals:
- Easy to read information About Us, eye-catching pictures encouraging customers to  take advantage of the offer long enough to understand the content but not to overwhelm.
- Easy to find contact details to ask questions about a trip
- Easy to find links to social media accounts to follow the group
- Design in mind for mobile devices first as this is recently the most common way of searching for information
- Fixed navigation bar providing user easy navigation reference.
- Fixed footer providing quick reference to Social Media links.

**2. Scope**

I chose the MVP (Minimal Viable Product) approach which:
- Provides users with pure UX
- Includes mobile-first website that is responsive on all devices.
- Fits with my current skills.
- Defines content quickly and focuses on contacting via email or social media. 

**3. Structure**
- The purpose of the Structure has been created as a single page website containing sections separated by captivating pictures using a parallax effect to encourage and attract the visitor's interest and  to enable users to quickly navigate through the website, easily assimilate information and have an overview of the trips to show what customers can expect.
- Contact details have been placed in different parts of the website (footer, contact form, main page button, tours section) for easy access by the user and are provided via e-mail, phone number and links to social media. 
- I initially decided to put the Gallery site separately to facilitate faster page loading due to the large number of images. However, after careful consideration of customers scrolling habits and feedback from the peer-code community I instead decided to include the Gallery as part of one scrollable, single-page website. This allows for easier navitgation and avoids code duplication. 
- A form will be added to the contact page with the following fields: "Full Name", "Email Address", "Tours Available" and "Subject" which are options to select. "Full Name", "Email Address" will be required in order to submit the form, "Email" input must be the valid format. User is alerted of correct input if data is invalid.

- [Contact](assets/wireframes/contact-page.png)

- Pages/Section: Home, About, Tours, Contact
- Gallery in a separated page (changed through project development)
- Fixed navigation bar - Menu headings and pointing to each of the 5 Pages
- Fixed footer with Contact email-link and phone number and Social Media icons, which will be opened in a new tab.

**5. Surface**

 **Colors**
- As a primary color, I have chosen the color green (#6cd22d) that is not only associated with Ireland, but also suggests freshness, nature and green landscapes. They will also match the images I have selected for the site. 
- As an additional color, I chose red (#dd3044) which I picked with the color picker from the image with skirts. That color will compliment green and make the important things like contact/sent buttons pop, so it will
 be noticed by the user immediately. The choice was made by reading this article [web builder expert](https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/designing-websites/how-to-choose-color-for-your-website/).
 - For the other colors I have chosen a combination of dark grey and off-white, which are the darker and lighter shades of primary green color to give a website a balanced contrast: 
 background color (#2d2d2a), body-text color (#fbfbfb), headings (#fbfbfb) and (#2d2d2a).
 
 ![altcolorspalette](assets/testing/cologit add .r-palette.png)

 Taking into account feedback on the peer-code-review, I've decided to tone down the original bright green color
 to a more neutral, eye-friendly one. For the website's background and text, I've chosen shades of grey, which I feel well complement the array of colors in the website.
 ![altcolorspalette](assets/testing/color-palette-changed.png)

 **Typography**
 
- For the main headings, I selected the same font that was used in The Hikers logo which is the 'Special Elite' with the group of fall-back font of 'Cursive'
- For the content I've chosen 'Oswald' font with fall-back font of 'Sans-Serif', which is a popular pairing font with 'Special Elite' according to [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

 **Images**

- The image selection has been chosen very carefully to charm users of the website with the beauty of Ireland and encourage to participate in offered trips
- The hero image (View of Wicklow landscape) and background images (forest and happy-girl) and for tours section were downloaded from the Pexels and Pixaby. I have chosen a group of selected images for the About Section and the Gallery.
- Video movies from the trips are from the youtube platform for better quality, showing an example of tours, which customers can participate in and exemplifying wonders of Ireland

## Features

**Existing Features**
- Designed with HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap.
- One page with 4 sections acting as individual sections.

**Features Left to Implement when skills develop**

Another feature idea
- To hide sticky navbar and footer on scroll on small devices and on landscape using javascript.
- The "Sent" button contact form need to be functional so the details can be sent to the server via php.
- Change short videos of excursions on the organized group trips, which today were implemented from youtube.
